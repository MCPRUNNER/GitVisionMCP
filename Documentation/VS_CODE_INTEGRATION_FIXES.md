# VS Code Integration Fix Summary

## Problem

The VS Code MCP client was showing parsing warnings:

```
Failed to parse message: 'info: ModelContextProtocol.Server.McpServer[1867955179]'
```

This was caused by Serilog logging output being sent to the console (stdout), which interfered with the JSON-RPC protocol messages in stdio transport mode.

## Root Cause

The .NET logging configuration was adding Serilog to the logging providers without clearing the default console provider. This meant both file logging (intended) and console logging (unintended) were active.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Logging Configuration

**File**: `Program.cs`

```csharp
// Before (problematic)
builder.Logging.AddSerilog(Log.Logger);

// After (fixed)
builder.Logging.ClearProviders(); // Clear default providers including console
builder.Logging.AddSerilog(Log.Logger);
```

### 2. Enhanced XML Attribute Search

**File**: `Services/LocationService.cs`

**Problem**: XML attribute queries (like `//user/@email`) were failing with XPath evaluation errors.

**Solution**: Replaced `XPathSelectElements()` with `XPathEvaluate()` for comprehensive XPath support:

```csharp
// Before (element-only support)
var results = xmlDoc.XPathSelectElements(xPath).ToList();

// After (comprehensive support)
var xPathResults = xmlDoc.XPathEvaluate(xPath);
var resultsList = new List<object>();

if (xPathResults is IEnumerable<object> enumerable)
{
    resultsList.AddRange(enumerable);
}
```

## Impact

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **VS Code Integration**: No more JSON-RPC parsing warnings
2. **XML Attribute Queries**: Now properly supported
   - Elements: `//user`, `/configuration/database`
   - Attributes: `//user/@email`, `//@name`
   - Text content: `//connection/text()`
3. **Clean stdio Transport**: Log output only goes to files

### ✅ Enhanced Features

1. **Structured XML Results**: `showKeyPaths` parameter works for both JSON and XML
2. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive XPath exception handling
3. **Production Ready**: Clean JSON-RPC communication for VS Code

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Build successful with no warnings
2. ✅ XML element queries working (`//user`, `//features`)
3. ✅ XML attribute queries functional (`//user/@email`, `//database/@host`)
4. ✅ Structured results with `showKeyPaths: true`
5. ✅ File-only logging confirmed (no console output)

## Deployment

The fixes are backward compatible and ready for production use. The MCP server now works seamlessly with VS Code without any parsing warnings or protocol interference.
