# Commit Search Tool Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive commit search tool for the selfDocumentMCP project that searches all commits for a specific string and returns detailed match information.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Data Models (Models/McpModels.cs)

- **CommitSearchResult**: Contains commit info and file matches for a single commit
- **FileSearchMatch**: Contains file name and line matches for a single file
- **LineSearchMatch**: Contains line number, content, and search string for a single match
- **CommitSearchResponse**: Top-level response with search metadata and results list

### 2. New GitService Method (Services/GitService.cs)

- **SearchCommitsForStringAsync**: Main search implementation that:
  - Searches through commit messages for the string
  - Searches through all file contents in each commit
  - Returns detailed match information including:
    - Commit hash, message, author, and timestamp
    - File names containing matches
    - Line numbers where matches occur
    - Full line content showing the match in context
  - Handles binary files gracefully (skips them)
  - Provides case-insensitive search
  - Configurable maximum commits to search (default 100)

### 3. MCP Server Integration (Services/McpServer.cs)

- **Tool Definition**: Added "search_commits_for_string" to the tools list with proper schema
- **Handler Method**: HandleSearchCommitsForStringAsync processes the search request
- **Result Formatting**: FormatSearchResults creates readable markdown output with:
  - Search summary (commits searched, matches found, total line matches)
  - Detailed results per commit with file and line breakdown
  - Proper markdown formatting for readability

### 4. Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Added tool description, use cases, and examples
- **EXAMPLES.md**: Added Copilot commands and JSON-RPC examples
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Updated to reflect 14 tools total and new search capabilities

## Key Features

✅ **Comprehensive Search**: Searches both commit messages and file contents
✅ **Detailed Results**: Returns commit details, file names, line numbers, and content
✅ **Case-Insensitive**: Finds matches regardless of case
✅ **Binary File Handling**: Gracefully skips binary files
✅ **Configurable Limits**: Allows setting maximum commits to search
✅ **Rich Formatting**: Returns well-formatted markdown results
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with meaningful error messages
✅ **Performance Conscious**: Limits search scope to prevent performance issues

## Usage Examples

### Via Copilot

```
@copilot Search all commits for "authentication" to find related changes
@copilot Find all commits that mention "bug fix" in messages or code
@copilot Look for "TODO" comments in all commits and show me where they are
```

### Via JSON-RPC

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 8,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_commits_for_string",
    "arguments": {
      "searchString": "authentication",
      "maxCommits": 50
    }
  }
}
```

## Return Format

The tool returns structured results with:

- Search summary (total commits searched, matching commits, total line matches)
- Per-commit details (hash, author, date, message, match count)
- Per-file breakdown (file name, match count, line details)
- Per-line details (line number, full line content)

This enables powerful code archaeology and helps developers:

- Track down bug histories
- Find feature development patterns
- Locate deprecated code
- Conduct security audits
- Generate comprehensive documentation

## Technical Implementation

The implementation leverages LibGit2Sharp to:

- Iterate through commits efficiently
- Access file trees for each commit
- Read file contents while handling encoding issues
- Provide robust error handling for various edge cases

The search is designed to be thorough but performance-conscious, with configurable limits to prevent excessive processing time on large repositories.
